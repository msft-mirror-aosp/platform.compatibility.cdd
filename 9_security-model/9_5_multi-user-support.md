## 9.5\. Multi-User Support

Android includes [support for multiple users](
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/UserManager.html)
and provides support for full user isolation.

*    Device implementations MAY but SHOULD NOT enable multi-user if they use
[removable media](
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment.html)
for primary external storage.

If device implementations include multiple users, they:

*   [C-1-1] MUST meet the following requirements related to
[multi-user support](
http://source.android.com/devices/storage/traditional.html).
*   [C-1-2] MUST, for each user, implement a security
model consistent with the Android platform security model as defined in
[Security and Permissions reference document](
http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html)
in the APIs.
*   [C-1-3] MUST have separate and isolated shared application storage
(a.k.a. `/sdcard`) directories for each user instance.
*   [C-1-4] MUST ensure that applications owned by and running on behalf a
given user cannot list, read, or write to the files owned by any other user,
even if the data of both users are stored on the same volume or filesystem.
*   [C-1-5] MUST encrypt the contents of the SD card when multiuser is enabled
using a key stored only on non-removable media accessible only to the system if
device implementations use removable media for the external storage APIs.
As this will make the media unreadable by a host PC, device implementations
will be required to switch to MTP or a similar system to provide host PCs with
access to the current userâ€™s data.
