e.g., whitelisting permitted message types and message sources.
*    [A-0-2] MUST watchdog against denial of service attacks from the Android
framework or third-party apps. This guards against malicious software flooding
the vehicle network with traffic, which may lead to malfunctioning vehicle
subsystems.
