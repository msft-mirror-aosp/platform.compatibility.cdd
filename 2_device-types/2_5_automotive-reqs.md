## 2.5\. Automotive Requirements

**Android Automotive implementation** refers to a vehicle head unit running
Android as an operating system for part or all of the system and/or
infotainment functionality.

Android device implementations are classified as an Automotive if they declare
the feature `android.hardware.type.automotive` or meet all the following
criteria.

### 2.5.4\. Performance and Power

If Automotive device implementations include features to improve device power
management that are included in AOSP or extend the features that are included

for each hardware component and the approximate battery drain caused by the
components over time as documented in the Android Open Source Project site.
*   [[8.4](#8_4_power_consumption_accounting)/A-0-2] MUST report all power
consumption values in milliampere hours (mAh).

hardware component itself if unable to attribute hardware component power usage
to an application.

If Automotive device implementations support multiple users, they:

*   [[9.5](#9_5_multi_user_support)/A-1-1] MUST include a guest account that
allows all functions provided by the vehicle system without requiring a user to
log in.

If Automotive device implementations support a secure lock screen, they:

user-specific authentication keys. [File-Based Encryption (FBE)](
https://source.android.com/security/encryption/file-based) is one way to do it.

Automotive device implementations:

*   [[9.14](#9_14_automotive_system_isolation)/A-0-1] MUST gatekeep messages
from Android framework vehicle subsystems, e.g., whitelisting permitted message
types and message sources.
*   [[9.14](#9_14_automotive_system_isolation)/A-0-2] MUST watchdog against
denial of service attacks from the Android framework or third-party apps. This
guards against malicious software flooding the vehicle network with traffic,
which may lead to malfunctioning vehicle subsystems.
