## 2.3\. Television Requirements

An **Android Television device** refers to an Android device implementation that
is an entertainment interface for consuming digital media, movies, games, apps,
and/or live TV for users sitting about ten feet away (a “lean back” or “10-foot
user interface”).

Android device implementations are classified as a Television if they meet all
the following criteria:
