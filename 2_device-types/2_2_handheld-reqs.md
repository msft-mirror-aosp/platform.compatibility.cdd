## 2.2\. Handheld Requirements

An **Android Handheld device** refers to an Android device implementation that is
typically used by holding it in the hand, such as an mp3 player, phone, or
tablet.

Android device implementations are classified as a Handheld if they meet all the
following criteria:

*   Have a power source that provides mobility, such as a battery.
*   Have a physical diagonal screen size in the range of 2.5 to 8 inches.

The additional requirements in the rest of this section are specific to Android
Handheld device implementations.
